## Setup on a Raspberry Pi
We recommend to initially run your bot in a local environment on your laptop before you run the translator on a Raspberry Pi. The local setup allows you to get familiar with the setup and the settings.

The following description allows a headless configuration. Only a network connection is required. This description is explicitly for running the bot on a Raspberry Pi 4, but the setup should be similar for earlier version.

Recommendation: run it locally first before putting the code on pi. Easier to ensure that .env variables are setup correctly.

### Step 1 - Write to SD card
Download the minimal image of Raspbian (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). This setup is based on Raspbian Buster Lite, July 2019.

Use balenaEtcher(https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to write the image on your SD card.

For more Information: See https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

### Step 2 - Enable SSH
Enable SSH by placing a file named “ssh” (without any extension) onto the boot partition of the SD card.

### Step 3 - Start and Login
* Pop your prepared SD card, power and a network cable into the Pi.
* Find your Pi's IP Address. Check your Router's DHCP allocation table or use a mobile app like Fing (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing) to find the IP of Pi.
* Install WinSCP and Putty on your Laptop.
* Start Putty and login into your Pi. Username: pi, PW: raspberry. Change your password with 'passwd'.

### Step 4 - Initial Setup
* Type `raspi-config` and change your locales
* Update the package lists from repositories: `sudo apt-get update`
* Update your repositories: `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`

### Step 5 - Install node and npm
The fastes way to install the current node and npm versions (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) was to follow the description from nodesource (https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md):
* Get the source: `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`
* Install: `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
* Check version: `node -v` and `npm -v`

### Step 6 - Get the code
It is recommend to install git and pull from your fork or main:
* Install git: `sudo apt-get install git`
* Create the folder for the source: `mkdir Rita`
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ZyC0R3/RitaBot.git`
* Checkout the branch you need: `git checkout --track origin/1.1.7`

Alternative: move the source code with WinSCP from your local environment to the Pi.

### Step 7 - Install the db
Install sqlite3 with `sudo apt-get install sqlite3`.

Create an empty database file (`sqlite3 database.db`)and call `.tables`)

### Step 8 - Copy your .env
Use WinSCP to copy your .env file from your local environment to the Pi.

### Step 9 - Run the code
* Install gulp is installed: `sudo npm install -g gulp` (not sure if still necessary)
* Make sure you are in the Rita folder
* Get and install all packages of RITA: `npm install`
* Build the code: `npm run-script build`
* Start the bot: `npm run-script start`

### Step 10 - Autostart
There are different ways to make the bot initialize at startup. The following description is based on `init.d` and `update-rc.d`:
* Create a `init.d` script: Edit the script template in `.pi/translate_bot` if necessary and copy it to the folder `/etc/init.d/` with `sudo mv .pi/translate_bot /etc/init.d/.`
* Make the file executable: `sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/translate_bot`
* Update the system script links: `sudo update-rc.d translate_bot defaults`
* Now, you can interact with the bot service with commands `sudo service translate_bot start`,  `sudo service translate_bot status` and `sudo service translate_bot stop`
* The logging will be in `/var/log/translate_bot.err` and `/var/log/translate_bot.log`
* Reboot and hope everything is running smooth: `sudo reboot`
* Enjoy (or return to step 4 in [Setting up a New Bot](#new-bot) if you haven't done yet)

### Step 11 - Updating the Bot
Update method via command line, minimal GUI interface needed
* Step 1: Naviagte to the directory where you ran `git clone` for your fork of the RitaBot repository.
  * `cd RitaBot`
  * `git status` should return the following `On branch master Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'. nothing to commit, working tree clean` if so preoceed to Step 2
  * if how ever you get the following messages you will need to resolve them before proceeding further.
    * `Changes not staged for commit:` you have the following options
      * Do this if you have changes you deam nesiciary to add only
        * (use "`git add <modified file>`" to update what will be committed) followed by `git commit -m <commit message>` and lastly `git push master`
        * If you are adding you own commits I'm assuming you know how to deal with potential merge conflicts and can appropriatly resolve them accordingly before rebase step.
      * The other and HIGHLY prefered method is to simply checkout the modifed files to avoid merge conflicts  (use "`git checkout -- . ` to discard changes all changes working directory)
        * Once you think you've gotten the branch back to `working tree clean` state by running `git status` one more time. You are ready to move on to Step 2
* Step 2: Now just run the following commands in order
  * `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ZyC0R3/RitaBot.git`
  * `git fetch upstream`
  * `git checkout master`
  * `git rebase upstream/master`
  * `git push -f origin master` (Note you will only have to use the `-f` flag for the first psuh)
    * enter your username and password from your Github account that's linked to the bot to complete the `git push`
  * Restart your stopped Web Dyno on the Heroku website.
  * Go to `Depploy` page on your Heroku app overview, scroll to the bottom and click `Deploy Branch` at the bottom in the Manual Deploy section.
* Congrats update to new bot is complete. You can verify the update by checking the version of the bot after it finishes rebooting with the trusty `!t stats` command
