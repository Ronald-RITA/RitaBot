Rita is an automatic translation bot built using `discord.js` and `Google Translate API`.

This Method does not need you to Fork this repository, you can run your bot straight off the Rita Master Branch. For update instructions click [here](/update/)

## Deploy to Heroku.

### Step 1 - Create a new [Discord App](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create)

* Give app a friendly name and click the **Create App** button
  * I like the name **C-3PO**, but feel free to pick something different if you fear George Lucas's wrath. Maybe **C-4PO**
* Take note of the app **CLIENT ID**, you will need it later.
* Scroll down to the **Bot** section.
* Click the **Create a Bot User** button
* Click the **Yes, do it!** button.
* Copy the bot's **TOKEN**, you will need it later.

### Step 2 - Deploy to Heroku

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Zyc0r3/RitaBot)

* In the custom variable of **DISCORD_TOKEN** put in the copied token of your created bot.
* **DO NOT CHANGE** the **NODE_MODULES_CACHE** Variable unless you know about Heroku Caching.
* If you wish to use Webhook Debug logging:
  * Fill in **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_ID** & **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_TOKEN**, For instructions go [here](#troubleshooting)
* Once installed, go to the **Overview** tab and click configure dynos. Turn off the default `web npm start` dyno and turn on the `worker node src/bot.js` dyno. Your bot will now be up and running!

### Step 3 - Invite your bot to your server and configure it!

* Replace the CLIENTID string in the following URL with your own apps client id from Step 2: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=8
* Visit the resulting URL and add your bot to any server where you have admin privileges.
* Once added, your bot should show up more or less instantaneously. Type `!t help` within the discord chat for more details on how to use it. Happy translating!
