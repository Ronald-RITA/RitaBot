Translates last message chain(s) in channel.  
A chain is a collection of messages by the same author, to keep things simple.

# Commands
```c++
> !t last
> !t last [n] to [lang] from [lang]
```  

# Parameters
* `to [lang]` - defaults to server default language  

* `to [lang, lang, ...]` - translates to multiple languages  

* `from [lang]` - defaults to automatic detection  

* `[n]` - number of chains to translate, default is 1  

* `[-n]` - negative number means only one chain is translated  

# Examples
```c++
> !t last 2
> !t last to english  
> !t last to english, german, french
> !t last -6 to english from german
```
