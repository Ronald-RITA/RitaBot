**Important Note**

*The bot's default prefix is !t (or !translate) - All commands must start with this prefix for the bot to process them.
Bot must have proper permissions in all relevant channels for full functionality (**read**, **write**, **react**, **mention**, **attachments**, **embed**).*

*Users who wish to receive automatic translations in private must **enable DMs** via **server privacy settings**.*

**These commands are available only to admins.**

# Set default server language
This changes the default Language of the server.
```c++
