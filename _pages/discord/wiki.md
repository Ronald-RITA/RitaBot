**Important Note**

* The bot's default prefix is `!t` or `!translate` - All commands must start with this prefix for the bot to process them.

* Your bot must have a set of permissions for it to function correctly. Here are the permissions your bot requires to function:
  * Read Permission
  * Write Permission
  * Embed Permission
  * Attachments Permission
  * Edit Channel Permission
  * Read Permission
  * React Permission
  * Mention Permission
    * The bot requires these sets of permissions to create webhooks for `embed off` translations and to function overall. Without these your bot will not function as it would not be able to translate or send messages without them.
